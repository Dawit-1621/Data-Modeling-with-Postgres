# Data Modeling with Postgres
An overview of the steps involved in performing data modeling with Postgres, creating a star schema database, and building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python for Sparkify. <br>
a. Define Schema:
* Identify the entities and their relationships within Sparkify's data (e.g., songs, artists, users, time, and songplays).<br>
* Create a logical schema that represents these entities and relationships. For instance:<br>
     * `songs table`
     * `artists table`
     * `users table`
     * `time table`
     * `songplays fact table`
