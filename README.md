# Data Modeling with Postgres
An overview of the steps involved in performing data modeling with Postgres, creating a star schema database, and building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python for Sparkify. <br>
1. Define Schema:
* Identify the entities and their relationships within Sparkify's data (e.g., songs, artists, users, time, and songplays).<br>
* Create a logical schema that represents these entities and relationships. For instance:<br>
     * `Songs table`
     * `Artists table`
     * `users table`
     * `timetable`
     * `songplays fact table`
2. Creating a Star Schema Database:
a. Implement Star Schema:
Transform the logical schema into a star schema design where a central fact table (e.g., songplays) is surrounded by dimension tables (e.g., `songs`, `artists`, `users`, `time`).
Connect dimension tables to the fact table using foreign keys.
Ensure denormalization in dimension tables for easier querying and analysis.
